# 📓 My Personal Notebook

Welcome to my personal portfolio of **Case Studies**.

While the main repository contains a library of *tools*, this section contains my **complete solutions**. 

Here, I document my journey of solving specific, high-value problems found on Upwork. For each project, I break down:
1.  **The Client's Problem:** The raw job description.
2.  **My Thought Process:** How I planned the architecture.
3.  **The Solution:** The visual workflow and the code.
